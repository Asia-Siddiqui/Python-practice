# Python Gamma projects

# Exercise 1 

#   Character input

name = input("What is your name: ")
age = int(input("How old are you: "))
year = str((2014 - age)+100)
print(name + " will be 100 years old in the year " + year)

# output is 

What is your name: Fawad
How old are you: 5
Fawad will be 100 years old in the year 2109


# Exercise 2

# odd or Even 

 num = int(input("give me a number to check: "))
check = int(input("give me a number to divide by: "))

if num % 10 == 0:
    print(num, "is a multiple of 4")
elif num % 2 == 0:
    print(num, "is an even number")
else:
    print(num, "is an odd number")

if num % check == 0:
    print(num, "divides evenly by", check)
else:
    print(num, "does not divide evenly by", check)
    
    # Output is
    
give me a number to check: 4
give me a number to divide by: 2
4 is an even number
4 divides evenly by 2

give me a number to check: 9
give me a number to divide by: 3
9 is an odd number
9 divides evenly by 3
